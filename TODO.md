#### TODO
* Show proper messages on error
* Make it work with environments other than Linux (absolute path check in current version would not work on Windows)
* Make overwrite configurable / show warning on overwrite
* Add a safety check that if the operation attempts to modify a file outside the current PWD, then a specific parameter should be passed
* Add support for downloading files from GitHub
* Add support for downloading files from any http/https path (may ask for an extra parameter to be passed for safety reasons)
* Make async version as well
* Consider adding a default json configuration file like bower.json, say copy-files.json
* Consider supporting basic bower.json
* Write test-cases
